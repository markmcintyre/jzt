		<h1>JZTScript Directions</h1>
		
		<p>Directions in JZT are evaluated by expression with the following syntax: 
			<code>[<em>modifier</em>][...] <em>direction</em></code>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Modifiers</h3>
		<p>Modifiers alter a specified direction. Here are the modifiers available in JZTScript</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>CW</dt>
			<dd>Clockwise: Modifies a value to be clockwise from a given direction. For example, CW of North
				 is East.</dd>
				
			<dt>CCW</dt>
			<dd>Counter-clockwise: Modifies a value to be counter-clockwise from a given direction. For example,
				CCW of North is West.</dd>
				
			<dt>OPP</dt>
			<dd>Opposite: Modifies a value to be the opposite of a given direction. For example, OPP of North
				of North is South.</dd>
				
			<dt>RNDP</dt>
			<dd>Random Perpendicular: Modifies a value to be, at random, a value perpendicular to a given
				direction. For example, RNDP of North may be either East or West, at random.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<p>There are two types of directions, concrete directions and calculated directions. Concrete directions
			are fairly self-explanatory:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>NORTH</dt>
			<dt>EAST</dt>
			<dt>SOUTH</dt>
			<dt>WEST</dt>
		</dl>
		<p>Note that you can also specify these as N, E, S, and W respectively as a short-hand form.</p>
		<p>Calculated directions require a bit of explanation:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>SEEK</dt>
			<dd>A direction toward the player from an object's current position.</dd>
			
			<dt>FLOW</dt>
			<dd>The same direction that an object last moved during its last command. If an object has never
				moved before, this value results in no direction (no movement).</dd>
				
			<dt>RAND</dt>
			<dd>A random direction, either North, South, East, or West.</dd>
			
			<dt>RANDF</dt>
			<dd>A random <em>free</em> direction. This is a direction relative to an object in which it is
				free to move. Note that objects do not consider themselves to be free to move even when
				an obstacle in the way is pushable.</dd>
				
			<dt>RANDB</dt>
			<dd>A random <em>blocked</em> direction. This is a direction relative to an object in which it is
				not free to move. Once again, note that objects consider themselves not to be free to move in
				a direction even if an obstacle is pushable.</dd>
				
			<dt>RNDNS</dt>
			<dd>A random direction, either North or South.</dd>
			
			<dt>RNDEW</dt>
			<dd>A random direction, either East or West.</dd>
			
			<dt>RNDNE</dt>
			<dd>A random direction, either North or East.</dd>
			
		</dl>
		
		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><code>OPP SEEK</code>: A direction away from the player's position.</li>
			<li><code>RNDP FLOW</code>: A random direction perpendicular to the direction an object last moved. For example, if an object was previously moving East, this will be interpreted as either North or South.</li>
			<li><code>CCW RNDNE</code>: Either North or West.</li>
		</ul>
