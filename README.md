# JZT

JZT is now open source! 

⚠️ **Be warned:** This repo is in *rough shape*. If you're thinking "Whoa, this looks like it was written a decade ago to run on a specific manually-configured dev machine," well you're not far off.

This started in 2013 before a lot of modern build tools and processes were in place (and the ones that were available, I probably wasn't familiar with at the time, since I was largely a backend dev by trade).

This was also a hacky personal project that for whatever reason I never really thought would go anywhere.

Still, I'm open sourcing it because, why not? If you're hoping to get it up and running today on your own machine, though, I suggest you wait.

So, here's my task list:

- [ ] https://github.com/markmcintyre/jzt/issues/2
- [ ] …Profit?
