# JZT

Better documentation is coming soon! In the meantime, here's how you can get JZT up and running locally:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Once the dev server is up and running, you can load JZT at `http://localhost:3000`. Changes will restart the server automatically, so you can reload the page to see the changes locally.
